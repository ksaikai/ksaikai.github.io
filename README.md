## Who is Kanan saikai 

I am currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Plant Pathology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison under the supervision of Dr. Ann E. MacGuidwin.


I received my M.S. in Plant Nematology at the University of Florida, advised by Dr. Donald W. Dickson.


My research is focused on plant-parasitic nematodes, its biology and modeling damage functions on economic crops.  I am particularly interested in education and extension for growers.
