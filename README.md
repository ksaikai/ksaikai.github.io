## Who is Kanan saikai 

I am currently a postdoc at International Institute of Tropical Agriculture in Nairobi, Kenya.
I received my Ph.D. in Plant Pathology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison under the supervision of Dr. Ann E MacGuidwin and my M.S. in Plant Nematology at the University of Florida, advised by Dr. Donald W. Dickson.
My research has focused on the biology and impact of plant-parasitic nematodes, with projects that range in scale from tissue culture to the field. My interest is with all aspects of plant-parasitic nematode biology and the diseases they cause of agricultural crops. This includes basic and applied research, education, and outreach via extension programs for growers. I have a keen interest of plant disease risk from nematodes and their impact on crop yields with emphasis on yield loss analyses.
