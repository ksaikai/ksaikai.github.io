**Who is Kanan Saikai?**

I am a postdoc at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture in Nairobi, Kenya, supervised by Dr. Daniel Coyne.
My research interests focus on plant-parasitic nematodes, its biology and modeling damage functions on economic crops. I am also interested in education and extension for growers.

Please follow @NemAfrica, the joint nematology research unit of IITA-ICIPE, on Twitter!
We tweet about our research/extension activities in Sub-Saharan Africa :)
