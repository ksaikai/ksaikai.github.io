**Who is Kanan Saikai?**

I work at Wageningen University & Research as a quantative nematologist.
My research interests focus on plant-parasitic nematodes, its biology and modeling damage functions on economic crops. I am also interested in education and extension for growers. 

My [CV](./cv/), [publications](./publication/), and [past presentation materials](./material/) are available from the side bar on the right corner of the main page.
