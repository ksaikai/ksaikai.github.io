**Hello, I am Kanan Saikai (Kutsuwa)**  

I am a nematologist employed at Ceradis, where my focus is primarily on plant-parasitic nematodes.  
My passion lies in developing eco-friendly solutions for nematode control, gaining a deep understanding of their biology, and comprehending the impact they have on economically important crops.  
Additionally, I am dedicated to investigating soil health through the analysis of nematode communities in soil.  
Education and outreach to support growers are also areas I'm enthusiastic about.

My [CV](./cv/), [publications](./publication/), and [past presentation materials](./material/) are available from the side bar on the right corner of the main page.
