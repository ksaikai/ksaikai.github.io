# Welcome to Kanan Saikai's webpage!
 
## Who is Kanan Saikai 
 
I am currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Plant Pathology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison under the supervision of Dr. Ann E. MacGuidwin.
I received my M.S. in Plant Nematology at the University of Florida, advised by Dr. Donald W. Dickson.
My research interests focus on plant-parasitic nematodes, its biology and modeling damage functions on economic crops. I am also interested in education and extension for growers.
 
 
My husband, Yuji Saikai, is also a PhD student in the department of Agriculture and Applied Economics at the UW-Madison. His research interests are in computational modeling and its applications to agricultural and food systems.
