**Who is Kanan Saikai?**

I am currently a postdoc at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture in Nairobi, Kenya, advised by Dr. Daniel Coyne.
I received my Ph.D. in Plant Pathology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and M.S. in Plant Nematology at the University of Florida, advised by Dr. Ann E MacGuidwin and Dr. Don Dickson, respectively.
My research interests focus on plant-parasitic nematodes, its biology and modeling damage functions on economic crops. I am also interested in education and extension for growers.


 
My husband, Yuji Saikai, also received his Ph.D degree recently in Agriculture and Applied Economics at the UW-Madison. His research interests are in computational modeling and its applications to agricultural and food systems.
