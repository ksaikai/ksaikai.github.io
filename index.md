**Welcome to Kanan Kutsuwa (Saikai)'s personal website**  

I am currently a researcher at Ceradis, a spin-off start-up of Wageningen University & Research. My primary role as a nematologist is to develop sustainable, green solutions for managing nematode diseases in crops. In addition, I am also involved in fungicide and herbicide development. It keeps me learning a lot of new things along the way!  

My [CV](./cv/), [publications](./publication/), and [past presentation materials](./material/) are available from the side bar on the right corner of the main page.
