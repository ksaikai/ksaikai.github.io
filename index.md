**Who is Kanan Saikai?**

I am currently a postdoc at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture in Nairobi, Kenya, supervised by Dr. Daniel Coyne.
I received my Ph.D. in Plant Pathology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison supervised by Dr. Ann E MacGuidwin and M.S. in Plant Nematology at the University of Florida advised by Dr. Don Dickson.
My research interests focus on plant-parasitic nematodes, its biology and modeling damage functions on economic crops. I am also interested in education and extension for growers.

Please follow @NemAfrica, the joint nematology research unit of IITA-ICIPE, on Twitter!
We tweet about our research/extension activities in Sub-Saharan Africa :)
