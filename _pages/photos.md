Nematodes are sophisticated animals with huge diversity in morphological characters. 
I will post nematode pictures (not necessarily taken by me) to share their beauty with you. 
Also, as a plant pathology PhD student, it is my honorable duty (I think) to show you how damaging they can be on a wide range of crops. So I will post some nematode damage images here probably...
Hope you will love them!

## Stitching imaging

Stitching imaging allows to "stitch" multiple images at high resolution. 

## Aggregative behaviour of *Pratylenchus* spp.

I find their aggregative behaviour very fascinating. 
*Pratylenchus* spp. can be easily grown on a tissue culture, so that allows us to observe their behaviour easier than *in vivo*.

*Pratylenchus* spp. is the third most economically important neamtode pathogen, and yet their damage potential is not well studied for many crops. This picture clealy indicates the impact of the neamtode on crop health!
