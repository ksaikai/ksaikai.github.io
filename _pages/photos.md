Nematodes are sophisticated animals with huge diversity in morphological characters. 
I will post nematode pictures (not necessarily taken by me) to share their beauty with you. 
Also, as a plant pathology PhD student, it is my honorable duty (I think) to show you how damaging they can be on a wide range of crops. So I will post some nematode damage images here probably...
Hope you will love them!

I love nematode stiching images.

## Aggregative behaviour of *Pratylenchus* spp.

I am always fascinated by their aggregative behaviour. They are so simple and yet very sophisticated animals. 
They look like nematode spaghetti.

*Pratylenchus* spp. is the third most economically important neamtode pathogen, and yet their damage potential is not well studied for many crops. This picture clealy indicates the impact of the neamtode on crop health!


## Lab picture - UF
This is not really a nematode photo, but this is a picture of me with other lab members in UF at a home party five years ago.
The most left Asian girl in the picture is me, and the only man in the picture is my M.S. advisor, Dr. Dickson. I learned so much about nematology from him. 
There is Dr. Janete, who is an amazing nematologist and wife of Dr. Dickson, in the picture as well (a lady with lovely curly hair).
