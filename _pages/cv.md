### Research Interest
My research focuses on the biology and impact of plant-parasitic nematodes, with projects that range in scale from tissue culture to the field. My interest is with all aspects of plant-parasitic nematode biology and the diseases they cause of agricultural crops. This includes basic and applied research, education, and outreach via extension programs for growers. I have a keen interest of plant disease risk from nematodes and thier impact on crop yields with emphasis on yield loss analyses.
